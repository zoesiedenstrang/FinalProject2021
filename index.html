            Hello, my name is Zoe Siedenstrang. I'm a senior at Boise State University studying Media Arts.
            This website displays everything I have created and learned throught the fall semester. This class was 
            extermely challenging for me. Before the semester started, I had no knowlege of web design or how webistes
            were created. At times this class was overwhelming but I have learned so much in these short 4 months. I hope
            you enjoy my creations and can see how far I have come this year. 
        </p>

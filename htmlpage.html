            HTML and CSS were the main subject matters we learned from this semester. HTML is used to display the information you want 
            on your website. CSS is what you use to <i>format and style your website</i>. I found that learning HTML and CSS is like 
            learning another language. There are so many tags and functions that can be used to create a website. 
        </p>
        <p>For the frist few projects we were assigned to make a website using HTML and CSS. For me, creating this simple website 
            was quite difficult. I was very confused at first but towards the end I got the hang of it. There are great resources
            online that I used to help find the correct tag to use. I think this website turned out pretty well considering that
            was my first time ever using HTML and CSS.

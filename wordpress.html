            This page is dedicated to the Wordpress assignment. Personally, I did not like working on wordpress.
            I foudn wordpress to be very difficult to navigate and personalize. I think wordpress is outdated and 
            there are so many other free website creaters out there.

            In this assingment we had to make a personal portfolio. This project was very beneficial to me becasue I can use
            this website as my portfolio to show future employers. I added photos I have taken, my resume, talked about my interests,
            and about myself. In the future I will build off this website and create something even better.
